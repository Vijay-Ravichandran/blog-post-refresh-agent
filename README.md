# Blog Post Refresh Agent

# Overview
This project demonstrates a system that refreshes an existing blog post by analyzing its structure, reviewing links and applying changes only after approval.

# System requirements/rules/features
- Link Evaluation: Flags weak or potentially outdated links.
- Structural Clarity: Checks if the blog has more than 6 sections and proposes merging the last 2 sections to simplify the structure
- Approval Simulation: Displays proposed changes with reasons and applies them only after approval.

# Key Constraints & Boundaries 
- No automatic content rewriting
- Links are evalauted based on simple rules, not full verification
- No real-time or external link validation 
- changes require manual approval, not a fully automated editing
