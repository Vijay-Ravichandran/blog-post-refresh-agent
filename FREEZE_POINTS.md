freeze point 1 
If the bolg has more than six sections, I have written a rule to merge the last 2 sections, but this removes the heading of the last section, which is not a perfect merging, but I still did it to show a real modification or change in the structure

freeze point 2
Identifying weak or broken links is challenging because a link may look valid but still be incorrect. I do not perform a full verification of links but still i classify links using simple rules. HTTPS + .com is considered strong, HTTP + .net is considered as weak and all are flagged for manual review
